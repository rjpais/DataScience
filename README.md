# DataScience
A repository for python and R scrips commonly used in Data Science problems. 

In this repository I include parts of code in phyton and R statistical software used for data analysis which I believe that can be reused in other problems. 
Thus each python and R scripts are unique modules that perform a task. I have adapted some to be as general as possibe such as they can be used in other contexts. 

Note : Some scripts require to be integrated to more code such as they can run.
