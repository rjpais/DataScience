# DataScience
A repository for python and R scrips commonly used in Data Science problems. 

In this repository I include parts of code in phyton and R statistical software used in data analysis which I believe that can be reused in other problems. 
Thus each python and R scripts are unique modules that perform a task. I adapted some to be as general as possibe such as they can be used in other contexts.
